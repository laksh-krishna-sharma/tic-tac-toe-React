#Project Overview:
A Tic Tac Toe game built with React, TypeScript, and CSS, allowing two players to compete against each other.

#Key Features:
TypeScript Integration: Utilize TypeScript for type safety, defining types for game state, player moves, and props.
Game Board: Create a 3x3 grid using React components, managing each cell's state.
State Management: Use React hooks (like useState and useEffect) to manage the current player, board state, and game outcome.
Game Logic: Implement functions to check for a win or draw after each move.
Reset Button: Add functionality to restart the game easily.
#Technologies Used:
React: For building the user interface.
TypeScript: For adding static types, improving code quality and maintainability.
CSS: For styling the game board, buttons, and overall layout.
#Learning Outcomes:
Gain experience with React component design and lifecycle.
Understand TypeScriptâ€™s benefits in a React application.
Implement game logic using conditionals and loops.
This project is a fun way to strengthen your React and TypeScript skills while building something interactive!
